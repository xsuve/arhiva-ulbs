# ArhivaULBS - University Exam Models Sharing Platform
ArhivaULBS is a platform where the students in my university can share and view exam models that have been sustained in the past years. This helps student get an in-depth idea on how the exam will be.

### Development
* HTML5
* CSS3
* PHP
* JavaScript/jQuery
* Later moved to WordPress

### Custom PHP Framework
It used a super basic custom PHP framework that can be found here: https://github.com/panique/mini
Later the platform has been moved to WordPress where I developed a custom WordPress plugin to extend it with custom functionalities.
